# Direct API Connection Setup

## Changes Made

Since CORS has been fixed in the backend, the OutixScanner app no longer requires a proxy server to connect to the API. The following changes have been made:

### 1. API Service Changes (`services/api.ts`)
- Removed all proxy-related functions:
  - `getProxyURL()`
  - `getCurrentProxyURL()`
  - `setManualProxyIP()`
  - `clearManualProxyIP()`
  - `testProxyConnectivity()`
- Updated all API calls to connect directly to `https://www.outix.co/apis`
- Changed authentication to use `URLSearchParams` instead of `FormData` for better compatibility
- Using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type for authentication
- **Fixed API Endpoints:**
  - Events: `GET /events` ✅
  - Guest List: `GET /guestlist/{eventId}` ✅  
  - QR Validation: `GET /validate/{eventId}/{scanCode}` ✅
  - QR Scanning: `GET /scan/{eventId}/{scanCode}` ✅
  - QR Unscanning: `GET /scan/{eventId}/{scanCode}?unscan=1` ✅
  - Authentication: `POST /auth` ✅
- **Fixed Headers:**
  - Authentication Header: Changed from `'auth-token'` to `'Auth-Token'` 
  - Content-Type: Removed from GET requests (was causing 400 errors)
  - Accept Header: Added `'Accept': 'application/json'` for all requests

### 2. Component Updates
- **`app/(tabs)/[id].tsx`**: Removed proxy-related imports and functions, updated network connectivity test to test direct API connection
- **`app/(tabs)/attendance/[id].tsx`**: Removed proxy-related imports and functions, updated network connectivity test

### 3. Package.json Updates
- Removed proxy-related scripts: `"proxy"` and `"dev"`
- Removed unnecessary dependencies:
  - `cors` (no longer needed for proxy)
  - `express` (no longer needed for proxy server)
  - `form-data` (replaced with URLSearchParams)
  - `concurrently` (no longer needed to run proxy and expo together)

### 4. Removed Files
The following files are no longer needed but kept for reference:
- `server.js` - The Express proxy server
- `PROXY_README.md` - Proxy setup documentation

## Running the App

Now you can simply run:

```bash
npm start
# or
npx expo start
```

No need to run the proxy server anymore!

## Network Testing

The app includes network connectivity testing that now tests direct connection to the backend API at `https://www.outix.co/apis/events`.

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Development**: No need to run and maintain a separate proxy server
2. **Better Performance**: Direct API calls are faster than going through a proxy
3. **Fewer Dependencies**: Reduced package size and complexity
4. **Production Ready**: The app now works the same way in development and production

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Internet Connection**: The app now requires direct internet access to `https://www.outix.co`
2. **Test Network Connectivity**: Use the built-in network test feature in the app
3. **Check API Status**: Verify that `https://www.outix.co/apis` is accessible
